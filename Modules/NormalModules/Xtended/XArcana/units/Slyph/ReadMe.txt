This is a set of four female mages, each using a different element for they sorcery (Air, Earth, Fire and Water/Ice). They all use custom animations that I converted from different games. The meshes are put together from different sources and further heavily modified with Blender. The same goes for the artwork, whereat I of course used Photoshop instead of Blender for the modifications. The attack animations are custom made with the use of the Civ4 effect database.

The polycount of the mage meshes are between 800 and 900 triangles, each unit uses a single 128*128 sized dds file for the artwork. The download contains a modular mod that will add the Mages as new units to the game. This way, they can be quickly inspected in-game and the necessary XML entries are available.
