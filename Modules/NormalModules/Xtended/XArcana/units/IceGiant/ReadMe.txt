This unit is a converted model from Atlantica Online. Therefore, although I made some modifications, I take no credit for the artwork and all rights are within NDOORS Corporation of course.

Most of my modifications were made to reduce the polycount and the size of the .dds files of the unit. None the less, the unit still has rather high polycount of about 2000 triangles. Thus I recommend to use this model for single mesh units only.

Because the mesh of the unit is rather small, I recommend a fScale setting of 0.7 in the Civ4ArtDefines_Unit.xml.

The unit uses its original AO animation that I converted for Civ4.
