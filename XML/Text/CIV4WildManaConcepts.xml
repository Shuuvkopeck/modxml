[H1]Gameoption - Flavor Start[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]
All civilizations start in regions matching their flavour, if such a region is available on the map. This means elves will usually start in heavy forested areas, dwarves in hills, and so on.

[H2]Choke and Vantage point Detection:[\H2] Goblin Forts, Ruins, Forts and sometimes Castles or even Citadels can be found on the map from the beginning. Not somewhere, but at strategical important choke points. Furthermore, FlavourMod places some Ancient Towers on valuable vantage points to help you survey.
[H2]Flavoured Unique Feature Locations:[\H2] The same as for starting plots is now true for Unique Features. Flavourful locations for each of them. The Maelstrom starts in a rather small sea or ocean (Sto's idea) and The Guardian of Pristin Pass guards a real "pass" in the mountains for example.

[H2]FFH Civilizations: Themes and Flavours[\H2]

Amurites: mage society -> reagents and mana
Bannor: lawful crusaders -> metals, to support their military society and religious fanatism
Balseraphs: crazy mind clowns -> dye, cotton, silk and sheep for colours and dresses
Calabim: vampire aristocraty -> high food potential area, to feed the human stock
Clan of Embers: orcs -> edge of the jungle, Pyre of the Seraphic to sacrifice angels
Doviello: age of ice barbarians -> light tundra, because they like it cold
Elohim: wardens of the secret sites -> all kinds of unique features
Grigori: stay away from the gods and their endless wars -> isolated or as far away as possible, seven pines
Hippus: mercenary horse lords -> flat featureless terrain to support mobility, horses
Illians: winter god worshippers -> snow, tundra, Letum Frigus
Khazad: gold dwarves -> hills, high commerce potential, pigs, gold
Kuriotates: sprawling cities -> three rings of high potential yield plots
Lanun: pirates -> coastal start, pearls
Ljosalfar: light elves -> thick forest, some dislike for colder regions
Luchuirp: dwarven tinkers -> hills, high hammer potential, pigs, marble, ivory
Malakim: desert people lead by an elf -> desert, incense, plains
Sheaim: arcane end of world prophets -> mana, reagents
Sidar: detached immortals -> isolated or as far away as possible
Svartalfar: dark elves -> forest, mana

The noble Houses of Erebus seek influence by offering their support to great empires.
[H2]Agendas of the noble Houses[\H2]
[ICON_BULLET]House Cannith: Research, Spellcraft
[ICON_BULLET]House Ghallanda: Innkeeping, Travel
[ICON_BULLET]House Kundarak: Trade, Banking
[ICON_BULLET]House Phiarlan: Entertainment
[ICON_BULLET]House Tharask: Armed conflict
[ICON_BULLET]House Vadalis: Nature
[H2]How to gain the Support of the Houses[\H2]
From time to time a noble House might offer you their Support. They will only offer their support if you have atleast 2 cities. Usually if your actions are in line with the agenda of a Noble House they will offer you their support. If you build a threatre for example House Phiarlan might offer you their support.
[H2]What's the advantage of having the Support of a Noble House?[\H2]
Among some minor advantages Houses usually give two major benefits: A support Trait and a powerful late game unit. For Example the Support trait of House Cannith gives 20% higher research and their Scholars are able to cast the Wall of Fire spell.
[H2]Is there a reason not to accept the support of a Noble House?[\H2]
If you do not please the Noble Houses by following their agenda to keep their support high, you might risk a Revolution in one of your cities.

The Support of a noble House decreases every turn a little bit so you need to find ways to increase their Support. For example if you research Astronomy to make travel over sea easier, the Support of House Ghallanda will increase. The Advisor Screen for the Noble Houses shows how high the current Support is. If the Support drops below 20 one of your cities is likely to revolt.

To keep the Support high in the long run you will need a high Support Modifier as it makes it easier to keep the Support on a high level.

Military units affect surroundings via combat influence: After each combat between two units: some amount of culture accumulated in each square of combat area is transferred from loser player/AI to winner player/AI. Combat area (i.e. influence radius) is: attacker plot, defended plot and near surrounding plots.
Note: This way I try to simulate effect of battle victory: some peoples have tendency to give up and flip to victorious side.

Military units affect surroundings via combat influence: After each combat between two units: some amount of culture accumulated in each square of combat area is transferred from loser player/AI to winner player/AI. Combat area (i.e. influence radius) is: attacker plot, defended plot and near surrounding plots.
Note: This way I try to simulate effect of battle victory: some peoples have tendency to give up and flip to victorious side.		</Spanish>

[H1]The Cult of Esus[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]
The Cult of Esus is a Semi-Religion and more of a Secret Society than a formal Religion. It's impossible to have Esus as State Religion (since this is visible to other players) and it is very difficult to figure out if someone follows the Cult of Esus or not.
[H2]Joining the Cult of Esus[\H2]
Aquiring Deception Tech allows to create the Join the Esus Cult Ritual. Once you follow the Cult of Esus you can never leave.
When joining the Cult of Esus, all Player Units with Empyrean Religion are assasinated and many other disciple units.
Recon Units from the Cult of Esus followers always have Esus Religion. Following the Cult of Esus prevents to have Empyrean as State Religion (but you can freely follow any other Religion, even Order)
The only way to see if you follow the Cult of Esus is to check if you can convert to Empyrean, so in MP you might want to make sure Empyrean doesn't spread to any of your cities. On the other hand a high spread of Empyrean allows to detect who follows the Cult of Esus and who does not.
[H2]Advantages of the Cult[\H2]
[ICON_BULLET]gain access to Gibbon Goetia, Shadowriders, Shadows, Cult of Esus Enforcer
[ICON_BULLET]gain access to special Equipment (so far Nightshade, Nightgear)
[ICON_BULLET]Bonus Promotions for new Units (like HN, or Poisoned Weapon)
[ICON_BULLET]More Bonus Promotions if the Cult of Esus Hall is build (but be aware that units with investigate ability can detect it in MP)
[H2]Cult of Esus disadvantages[\H2]
[ICON_BULLET]Less mana is produced (-20%)
[ICON_BULLET]Cannot Train Mardero, Sphener, Yvain, Hemah, Arthendain
[ICON_BULLET]cannot upgrade Priests to Tier4 units
[ICON_BULLET]can only have a max of two of any disciple unittype

[H2]Esus Miracles:[\H2]
Heal
Move in the Shadows (gain HN promotion)

[H2]Enforcer of the Cult of Esus Abilities:[\H2]
Infiltrate City Guard (increases crime rate and thus makes his other abilites easier to perform)

[H1]Fantasy Mapscripts[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]
There are several fantasy mapscripts included in Wildmana.
[H2]Erebus[\H2]
Mapscript made by Cephalo for Fall from Heaven.
Fantasy worlds often have distinct regions or valleys that have their own special climate or atmosphere. Some examples would be Mordor from LOTR, or most of the regions in World of Warcraft. Well this map script is designed to have various 'valleys' connected to one another through mountain passes, such that each region is kindof a fortress on it's own.

Because this map script was created for FFH2, starting locations and other features are placed based on what is known about each civs fictional terrain preferences. These preferences are tunable toward the beginning of the script
[H2]ErebusContinents[\H2]
Mapscript made by Seven05 for Fall from Heaven.
ErebusContinent is a map script for Fall From Heaven 2 that simulates a single continent or region. The world is generated using a detailed heightmap which is modified by plate tectonics. A climate simulation is run using this heightmap to create realistic climate zones based on the shape of the landmasses and the altitude of the heightmap. Mountain ranges follow the natural plate boundries creating detailed and beliveable mountain ranges and passes and the climate model reflects this with effects such as 'rain shadows' near mountain ranges and lush jungles or forests in areas of heavy rainfall.

Player starting locations are chosen based on the 'flavor' of each civilization. The Malakim will be in the desert, the Illians in the snow, the Lanun on the coast and so on. Every effort is made to ensure the starting locations are also playable and not just flavorful. This means jungles and forests will be cleared around civs that can't take advantage of them and the peaks and hills can be reduced or flattened to ensure you have enough room to grow (and the dwarves have some flat land for food). Some civilizations are also given preferences starting near other civs or off by themselves. In multiplayer games (and only in multiplayer games) civs are less likely to be isolated from the other civs in the game as all civs are encourage to pick the best spot available for them starting furthest from the map edges.

[H2]WildErebus[\H2]
Mapscript made by Zerzes for Civilization4

[ICON_BULLET]It's a regional map with no oceans, but several lakes.
[ICON_BULLET]Lots of easily defended passes and border lines, thanks to an abundance of mountain ridges and snaky lakes. However, it's a dynamic script so wide plains are also possible.
[ICON_BULLET]Fewer luxury and food resources to increase the strategic importance of the existing ones.
[ICON_BULLET]Base food resources. Game in forest, Banana in jungle, Fish in lakes, Wheat in plains.
[ICON_BULLET]Rare resources. Many resources have fewer occurences than the number of players, but with the possibility of one major location with up to 6 adjacent plots with the resource. The owner of such locations will have a good trading position.
[ICON_BULLET]Climate regions. Areas of different climate (desert, tundra, etc) are fractally placed and not tied to latitude.
[ICON_BULLET]Clustered strategic resources. Because who doesn't want to have a city with lots of iron hills?
[ICON_BULLET]All plots on the map can be reached by land. (I believe this script actually works now. It wasn't fool proof in Boreal.)

The goal is that the script should generate a sane map with the possibility to find insane city locations!

[H2]MountainCoast[\H2]
Mapscript made by Lonkero173 for Fall From Heaven
Heavily inspired by J.R.R.Tolien's Middle Earth as well as the "Erebus" map script by Rich Marinaccio

The main point of this script is to create credible mountain ranges that are large enough to be strategically important without overly
disturbing movement. There should rarely be any absolutely critical chokepoints (lone entrances to valleys), but maintaining control of choke points should be important nevertheless

[ICON_BULLET]Climate regions. Areas of different climate (desert, tundra, etc) are fractally placed and not tied to latitude.
[ICON_BULLET]Clustered strategic resources. Because who doesn't want to have a city with lots of iron hills?
[ICON_BULLET]All plots on the map can be reached by land. (I believe this script actually works now. It wasn't fool proof in Boreal.)

The goal is that the script should generate a sane map with the possibility to find insane city locations!

[H2]MountainCoast[\H2]
Mapscript made by Lonkero173 for Fall From Heaven
Heavily inspired by J.R.R.Tolien's Middle Earth as well as the "Erebus" map script by Rich Marinaccio

The main point of this script is to create credible mountain ranges that are large enough to be strategically important without overly
disturbing movement. There should rarely be any absolutely critical chokepoints (lone entrances to valleys), but maintaining control of choke points should be important nevertheless</French>
        <German>[H1]Fantasy Mapscripts[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]
There are several fantasy mapscripts included in Wildmana.
[H2]Erebus[\H2]
Mapscript made by Cephalo for Fall from Heaven.
Fantasy worlds often have distinct regions or valleys that have their own special climate or atmosphere. Some examples would be Mordor from LOTR, or most of the regions in World of Warcraft. Well this map script is designed to have various 'valleys' connected to one another through mountain passes, such that each region is kindof a fortress on it's own.

Because this map script was created for FFH2, starting locations and other features are placed based on what is known about each civs fictional terrain preferences. These preferences are tunable toward the beginning of the script
[H2]ErebusContinents[\H2]
Mapscript made by Seven05 for Fall from Heaven.
ErebusContinent is a map script for Fall From Heaven 2 that simulates a single continent or region. The world is generated using a detailed heightmap which is modified by plate tectonics. A climate simulation is run using this heightmap to create realistic climate zones based on the shape of the landmasses and the altitude of the heightmap. Mountain ranges follow the natural plate boundries creating detailed and beliveable mountain ranges and passes and the climate model reflects this with effects such as 'rain shadows' near mountain ranges and lush jungles or forests in areas of heavy rainfall.

Player starting locations are chosen based on the 'flavor' of each civilization. The Malakim will be in the desert, the Illians in the snow, the Lanun on the coast and so on. Every effort is made to ensure the starting locations are also playable and not just flavorful. This means jungles and forests will be cleared around civs that can't take advantage of them and the peaks and hills can be reduced or flattened to ensure you have enough room to grow (and the dwarves have some flat land for food). Some civilizations are also given preferences starting near other civs or off by themselves. In multiplayer games (and only in multiplayer games) civs are less likely to be isolated from the other civs in the game as all civs are encourage to pick the best spot available for them starting furthest from the map edges.

[H2]WildErebus[\H2]
Mapscript made by Zerzes for Civilization4

[ICON_BULLET]It's a regional map with no oceans, but several lakes.
[ICON_BULLET]Lots of easily defended passes and border lines, thanks to an abundance of mountain ridges and snaky lakes. However, it's a dynamic script so wide plains are also possible.
[ICON_BULLET]Fewer luxury and food resources to increase the strategic importance of the existing ones.

Everytime a unit is built as long as the unit is alive, is not a hero, and is not a settler or worker the terrain around the building city is checked. There is a small chance that the unit will receive a bonus, terrain-oriented promotion based on the current terrain around the city.

Three of the possible promotions are already existing ones:

Winterborn - Based on number of Snow and Tundra tiles (Illians and Doviello are excluded from this check)
Demon-slaying - Based on the number of Hell terrain tiles (Infernal are excluded from this check)
Amphibious - Based on the number of Shore tiles
And three are brand new:

Cliff Walker - Based on the number of Hills and Peak tiles
+10% attack and defense in hills

Sand Devil - Based on the number of Sand tiles
+10% attack and defense in desert

Tree Warden - Based on the number of Forest, Ancient Forest and Jungle tiles (both elven civs have reduced chance to receive this promotion)
+10% attack and defense in Forest, Ancient Forest and Jungle

It is possible (though extremely unlikely) for a single unit to get all six promotions if they have at least one tile that fits into each category around their city.
